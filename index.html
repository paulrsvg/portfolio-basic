    <h1>Paul Russavage</h1>
    <h2>Web Developer | UX Researcher | Data Scientist</h2>
    <hr/>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm a college student majoring in Data Science, which is a healthy blend of programming and statistics. 
        I'll be graduating in April, so I'm open for full-time roles after that. You should hire me!
    </p>
    <p> I consider myself to be a thoughtful yet creative generalist. I strive to make connections across disciplines and departments. I love gathering and synthesizing information, like a sponge for knowledge. I don't mind going out of my way to help others solve technical problems, whether that be a family member or a coworker. I use computers to help me explore ways to solve problems old and new. Recently I've been thinking and reading about ethics in AI, Design Thinking and collaboration, and how people make things physically vs. digitally.</p>

   <p>I believe that People > Data, and a human-centered approach to data science is the best way forward.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I've taught myself web development as I've gone through school which led to me taking some classes to augment my self-taught learning. By doing this, I've ended up exploring and learning a great deal. I've also received minors in Digital Humanities and Design Thinking.  
        Some projects I've worked on (outside of school) are listed below:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Splashy Karp: A Flappy Bird clone made with Phaser.js

        </li>
        <li>Retro Games: A Breakout clone made with Vanilla.js and the Canvas API
            (<a href= "https://github.com/paulrsvg/breakout-clone">Code</a>| 
            <a href="https://brk-out.glitch.me/">Demo</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Machine Learning: Object detection with MobileNet and Tensorflow.js

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I think the common theme I can draw upon across my work life is data. I've gained an understanding of how to deal with, create, and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data.</p>
